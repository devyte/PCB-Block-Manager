# Block Manager - hardware files for the Block Manager board
These are the printed circuit board (PCB) files, CAD files, specification sheets and all technical drawings needed to make the DKblock Block Manager board. There are two boards that make a minimum DK system, a Block Manager PCB and a Pack Supervisor PCB (with software changes to the 20 client version provided). Note that the bill of materials (BOM) and other technical documents can be opened in OpenOffice format and PCB files are in EAGLE format.
One version is provided, that is Rev D which is a fully tested board.
